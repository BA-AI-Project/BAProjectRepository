    Monitoring Errors: Regulary monitoring for errors and reporting them is crucial gor identifying problematic areas and connecting errors for future applications
    Data compliance: Ensuring that data adheres to specific Specifications determines its quality and usability for analysis
    Data Accuracy: Ensuring that the data is accurate and closelynalignedwith the actual values is essential.
  Data Reduction
    Compression data reduction involves compressing data to reduce amount of storage required this can be achieved using loosy or loseless compression techniques,
    depending on the data and its requirements.
