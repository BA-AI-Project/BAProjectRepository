# OBJECTIVES

### Business Objectives
Collect waste/trash/garbage
Reduce human health risks and threats
Keep the environment clean
Minimize littering
Providing recyclable materials
Resource recovery 

### Business Background
A robot is described as a programmable device composed of electronic, electrical,
and/or mechanical components that can perform tasks that are typically carried out by
humans. The focus here is on its ability to work in confined spaces, carry out repetitive
tasks without getting bored, and maintain unwavering focus on ongoing tasks.

### Business Success Criteria
*Sensing Bin Levels: The robot's capability to sense the fill level of garbage
bins is crucial for optimizing collection routes and schedules, ensuring timely
disposal, and preventing overflow.

*Waste Management Planning: Efficient waste management involves strategic
planning for garbage collection routes, scheduling, and resource allocation. The
robot's ability to contribute to waste management planning can enhance the
overall process.

*Garbage Treatment: Beyond collection, the robot's involvement in garbage
treatment could encompass sorting, separating recyclables, and possibly even
preliminary processing of waste materials.

*High-Speed Stability: The robot should be able to maintain stability and
perform its tasks at high speeds without compromising safety or efficiency.

### Constraints and Risks
*Minimal synchronization

*Collect Regardless of Activity: The robot should collect garbage irrespective
of the ongoing activities around it.It should be able to navigate its environment and perform its tasks safely.

*Human Detriment: The potential risk to humans in terms of safety and job
displacement should be carefully considered. Steps should be taken to minimize
risks and ensure that the introduction of robots benefits society as a whole

### Requirements
*Motor driver circuit for controlling the movement of the robot
*Power supply A sufficient and reliable power supply is essential to provide the
energy needed for the robot's motors, sensors, and other components
*Motion-controlling unit
*Automatic motion of the robot is obtained by using sensors in the navigation
system.
*Garbage collection mechanism
*Data processing and decision-making
*Safety measures
*Automatic Motion using sensors enables the robot to navigate autonomously
*Metallic structure
