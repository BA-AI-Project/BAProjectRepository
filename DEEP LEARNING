DEEP LEARNING

Effective Problem Solving: Deep learning offers effective problem-solving 
capabilities by learning representations from data. It can automatically learn 
features from the data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.

Handling Large Data: Deep learning excels at handling large and complex 
datasets. This is particularly beneficial for tasks like image recognition, where 
extensive data is available.

It uses a deep neural network (namely, GarbageNet) to detect different types of
recyclable garbage.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are a type of deep learning 
architecture particularly well-suited for image analysis tasks. They use 
convolutional layers to automatically learn features from images.

    DETECTION AND NAVIGATION

Trash Detection: The system uses CNNs to detect trash on the ground and 
nearby. This is a crucial step in identifying where garbage needs to be collected.

Location Determination: After detecting trash, the system uses image analysis 
to determine the location of the trash. This information is vital for the robot's 
navigation.

Navigation Algorithm: A separate algorithm calculates the distance between 
the robot and the trash and generates navigational directions for the robot. This 
ensures that the robot can reach the detected trash efficiently.

Microprocessor Integration: The microprocessor receives the position of the 
garbage and the navigation instructions. It's responsible for controlling the 
robot's movements based on this information.

Robot Movement: The microcontroller directs the robot's movements based on 
the learned location of the trash and the navigation instructions.

Trash Collection: Upon reaching the detected trash, the robot uses a robotic 
arm to collect the trash.

Disposal: The robot deposits the collected trash into a drawer integrated into 
its body.
