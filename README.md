Our AI solution for communities

1. INTRODUCTION

AI SOLUTION:

Waste management is a big issue globally and it needs serious attention. There is no 
proper management of waste and garbage in rural and urban areas in Vereeniging.
Our team has developed an AI solution to build a robot called TRASHBOT that 
employs an AI algorithm to detect garbage before collecting it as a result of 
conducting this research and examining the issues with waste management. The 
TRASHBOT will help collect any trash that can cause littering in the community to 
avoid health issues and pollution caused by littering.

PROBLEM DEFINITION

The problem at hand is the lack of effective waste management practices in a 
rural community. Inadequate waste collection schedules, improper disposal 
methods, and limited resources contribute to uncontrolled littering and 
pollution. This not only harms the environment but also poses health risks to 
residents. Without proper waste management, the community's aesthetics 
decline, and the potential for disease outbreaks increases.
Therefore we will deploy a smart robot that is going to offer automatic waste 
collection control. It differentiates between stable and moving barriers and 
adjusts its movements accordingly. It has sensors at various levels to find a 
moving obstruction. The TRASHBOT will pick up trash on the streets, schools, 
hospitals, malls, etc. It will also monitor fill levels detect if it is overflowing, and
dispose of the waste in a designated location. The TRASHBOT will benefit the 
community by improving public health, reducing pollution-related costs, and 
enhancing the community's overall living standards
