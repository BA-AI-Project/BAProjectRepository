# THEORETICAL_ASPECTS

### Machine Learning Approach
*Supervised Learning Approach will be employed we will provide the
machine learning algorithm with a labeled dataset. Each example in the dataset
will consist of input features and the corresponding correct output (label). The
algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on the provided examples. The
process involves making predictions and adjusting its internal parameters to
minimize prediction errors.

*Training Data and Example Instructions: The operator prepares a dataset
with known inputs and corresponding outputs. These are used to train the
machine learning model. The algorithm's objective is to learn the underlying
patterns in the data to make accurate predictions on new, unseen examples.

*Model Training and Prediction: The SVM algorithm will be used to build a
model. It is used for both classification and regression tasks. In classification, it
aims to find a hyperplane that best separates the data points of different classes
while maximizing the margin between them.

*Correction and Iteration: During the training process, the algorithm will make
predictions on the training data. The operator will compare the algorithm's
predictions with the actual labels and provide corrections when discrepancies
arise. This iterative process continues until the algorithm's performance reaches
a satisfactory level.

### Classification 
The goal is to assign input data points to predefined categories or classes. Support
Vector Machine is a classification algorithm that works well for both linear and nonlinear data separation.

 *Support Vector Machine Algorithm: Support Vector Machines are powerful
  algorithms for classification and regression tasks. They aim to find a hyperplane
  that best separates the data points of different classes while maximizing the
  margin between them. SVM can handle linear and non-linear separation, and
  there are variations like kernel SVM that allow it to operate in higher-dimensional
  spaces without explicitly mapping to those spaces.

 *Model Evaluation: Once the model is trained, it's important to evaluate its
  performance on unseen data (testing data) to ensure that it generalizes well.
  Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy and
  precision.
