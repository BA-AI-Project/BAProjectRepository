# THEORETICAL_ASPECTS

### Machine Learning Approach
*Supervised Learning Approach will be employed we will provide the
machine learning algorithm with a labeled dataset. Each example in the dataset
will consist of input features and the corresponding correct output (label). The
algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on the provided examples. The
process involves making predictions and adjusting its internal parameters to
minimize prediction errors.

*Training Data and Example Instructions: The operator prepares a dataset
with known inputs and corresponding outputs. These are used to train the
machine learning model. The algorithm's objective is to learn the underlying
patterns in the data to make accurate predictions on new, unseen examples.

*Model Training and Prediction: The SVM algorithm will be used to build a
model. It is used for both classification and regression tasks. In classification, it
aims to find a hyperplane that best separates the data points of different classes
while maximizing the margin between them.

*Correction and Iteration: During the training process, the algorithm will make
predictions on the training data. The operator will compare the algorithm's
predictions with the actual labels and provide corrections when discrepancies
arise. This iterative process continues until the algorithm's performance reaches
a satisfactory level.

### Classification 
The goal is to assign input data points to predefined categories or classes. Support
Vector Machine is a classification algorithm that works well for both linear and nonlinear data separation.

 *Support Vector Machine Algorithm: Support Vector Machines are powerful
  algorithms for classification and regression tasks. They aim to find a hyperplane
  that best separates the data points of different classes while maximizing the
  margin between them. SVM can handle linear and non-linear separation, and
  there are variations like kernel SVM that allow it to operate in higher-dimensional
  spaces without explicitly mapping to those spaces.

 *Model Evaluation: Once the model is trained, it's important to evaluate its
  performance on unseen data (testing data) to ensure that it generalizes well.
  Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy and
  precision.

### Model
Computer Vision and Object Recognition: Computer vision algorithms are
employed to enable machines to understand and interpret visual information from
images and videos.

 *Requirements to accomplish this algorithm
  *Creating Visual Datasets: training computer vision model, requiring a dataset
   of images that the model can learn from. These images need to be labeled,
   indicating what objects or features are present in each image, images of
   garbage, waste materials, and related objects would be labeled with information
   such as the product brand, item shape, and material type.
 
  *Manual Labeling of Images: To create garbage datasets involves manually
   annotating images. This means reviewing each image and applying the
   appropriate labels. For example, an image of a plastic bottle might be labeled
   with the brand name, the shape of the bottle, and the material (plastic).

 *Vision AI Platforms from Plain Sight provides:
  *Rapid labeling for assigning labels to objects in images
  *End-to-end model building for building, training, and deploying computer
   vision models
 *No-code approach
 *And automatically training datasets containing waste-related images or
  videos.

### Time series analysis of data
Time series analysis involves studying data points collected over time intervals to
understand patterns, trends, and relationships.
 
  *Time Series Data: A time series is a sequence of data points indexed in time order.
   Each data point corresponds to a specific time instance.
   
  *Techniques: Time series analysis techniques include identifying trends, seasonality,
   cyclic patterns, and irregular fluctuations in the data.


### Solution techniques
  *Reference Counting: Each object has a reference count associated with it.
   When a new reference to the object is created, the reference count is increased,
   and when a reference is removed or goes out of scope, the reference count is
   decreased. When the reference count drops to zero, it means the object is no
   longer reachable and can be safely deallocated.

  *Mark and Sweep (Garbage Collection): Mark and Sweep is a garbage
   collection technique used to automatically manage memory by identifying and
   reclaiming memory that is no longer in use. The process involves two main
   phases,namely Marking and Sweeping.
   
   *Marking: The process starts with the root set, which includes all memory
    locations that are directly accessible by the program (e.g., machine registers,
    stack, and static data regions). The garbage collector recursively traverses all
    reachable objects and marks them as in use.

   *Sweeping: Once all reachable objects are marked, the garbage collector
    sweeps through the memory and deallocates memory blocks that are not
    marked. These unmarked blocks are considered garbage as they are not
    reachable from the root set. This phase releases memory that is no longer
    needed.

### Natural language processing (NLP)
Natural Language Processing is a field of AI that focuses on enabling machines to
understand, interpret, and generate human language. Natural Language Processing
can have various applications, such as communication between the robotic system and
humans or processing textual data related to waste management.

  *Interacting with Computers: Natural Language Processing allows humans to
   communicate with computers using natural language, which can include spoken or
   written language.

  *Instructions and Decisions: Natural Language Processing can be used when you
   want to give instructions to the robot through text or voice commands. It can also help
   in making decisions based on textual information, like reports or instructions.
